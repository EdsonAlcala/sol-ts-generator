# Generate Typescript type definitions from Solidity

Generate typescript type definitions from Ethereum smart contracts ABI that will allow you to write static typed Typescript tests in your Truffle projects

# Background

Inspired by the amazing work of https://blog.hellobloom.io/how-typescript-makes-smart-contracts-easier-to-test-and-more-robust-c612a2d99537

and https://github.com/Neufund/TypeChain

I decided to turn those ideas into a simple package

# Install

# Options

You can specify options

By default the type generated is going to be here..
But you can define your own route...

# Commands

// to create a package
npm init

npm addUser
npm publish
npm version patch // we should version manually or with this command

// config where we specify the folder where the contracts are located
// path has to be diferent
// this thing should write to disk

// Typechain algorithm
// Get all files
// parse
// generate
// write
// prettier
